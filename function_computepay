#Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. 
#Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. 
#Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. 
#The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75).
